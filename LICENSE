DISCLAIMER FOR MENTAL HEALTH APPLICATION

EmocionalIA+ is a complementary support tool and does NOT replace professional 
mental health treatment, diagnosis, or therapy. This software is provided for 
informational and supportive purposes only.

IMPORTANT NOTICES:

1. NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL CARE
   This application does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. 
   Always seek the advice of qualified health providers with any questions 
   regarding mental health conditions.

2. EMERGENCY SITUATIONS
   If you are experiencing a mental health emergency or crisis, contact 
   emergency services immediately:
   - Ecuador: ECU 911 or Mental Health MSP: 171
   - International: Contact local emergency services

3. AI LIMITATIONS
   The AI assistant uses OpenAI technology but is not a licensed therapist. 
   Responses are generated automatically and may not be appropriate for all 
   situations. Crisis detection is automated but not infallible.

4. DATA PRIVACY
   While we implement security measures including encryption and GDPR 
   compliance, users should be aware that no system is 100% secure. Sensitive 
   personal health information is collected and stored.

5. NO FINANCIAL ADVICE
   Any premium features or subscriptions are for enhanced app functionality 
   only and do not constitute financial or investment advice.

6. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   This application is not regulated by health authorities. Users in 
   jurisdictions requiring specific certifications (e.g., HIPAA in USA) 
   should consult legal counsel before use in clinical settings.

7. CHILDREN AND MINORS
   This application is intended for users 18 years and older. Use by minors 
   requires parental/guardian consent and supervision.

8. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
   The application integrates with third-party services (OpenAI, Stripe, 
   Twilio) which have their own terms and privacy policies. We are not 
   responsible for their services or data handling.

THE AUTHORS AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, 
INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING 
FROM THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA, 
MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, OR ADVERSE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES.

BY USING THIS SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS DISCLAIMER 
AND AGREE TO ITS TERMS.
